# mixnet

Function to extend finite mixture regression modeling through `flexmix` with variable selection abilities by likelihood regularization with `glmnet`. Main use is for heterogeneous and high-dimensional data. This approach merges simultaneous estimation based on the EM algorithm with continuous variable selection into a single feasible procedure. The function combines the value of mixture modeling and continuous feature selection resulting in a synergy of their advantages. The flexibility allows for finding groups of related observations while selecting the optimal subset of variables within these groups independently. Regularization is based on the elastic net allowing for L1 (LASSO) and L2 (Ridge) regularization or a weighted combination of the two (Elastic Net).
